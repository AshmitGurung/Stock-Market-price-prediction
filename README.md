# Stock-market-price-prediction

This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data and machine learning techniques. The prediction model is built using LSTM neural networks to provide accurate forecasting based on trends.

## Features

- Fetch real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.
- Data preprocessing and manipulation with `pandas` and `numpy`.
- Build predictive models using `tensorflow` and `keras`.
- Visualize stock price trends and predictions using `matplotlib`.
- Deploy the prediction model in an interactive web app using `streamlit`.
