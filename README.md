Project Overview
This project is designed to predict future stock prices based on historical data fetched from Yahoo Finance using yfinance. We use various libraries like numpy, pandas for data manipulation, tensorflow and keras for building deep learning models, and scikit-learn for pre-processing and evaluation. The predictions are displayed using a web interface built with streamlit.
